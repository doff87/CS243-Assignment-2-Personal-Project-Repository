Development Process

The overall project went fairly well. I had some difficulty kicking off the rust of not using python, but I quickly adapted. The program itself runs fine and no particular

difficulties with the usage of git or GitHub. One tricky part of this project was a function of how I wanted my git repository to be viewed. It still isn't perfect, but I

was able to set my assignment repository as a submodule of my class repository. I like this as it mirrors my local setup. Git was helpful for version control and working

between my laptop and desktop seamlessly.
